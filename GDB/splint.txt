Splint tool :
+++++++++++++
The UNIX Lint tool Secure Programming Lint (SPLINT), can assist in checking for a multi-
tude of programming errors. Check out the online manual pages (man splint) for complete de-
tails of the splint.

--> To run splint simply enter the command:
    $ splint myprog.c

Splint is particularly good at checking type checking of variable and function assignments, effi-
ciency, unused variables and function identifiers, unreachable code and possible memory
leaks. There are many useful options to help control splint (see man splint).
